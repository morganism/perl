###   MSS Hack Readme ### 

Some feeds such as the Ericsson R13 MSS feed have asn1 data in 4096 bytes blocks with zero padding at the end. Using the standard ASN1 definitions means that the files need to be decoded in 4096 byte blocks and will raise an error message such as:

	Decode failed past byte 3416: Input processing error

In order to resolve this there are some changes that you can make to the definition and to the source code generated by the asn1c program to enable you decoder to treat these blocks as though they were padding elements. 

This directory contains the modified asn1 definition and copies of the modified source code files (only the modified c files saved here not all the asn1c source code)
